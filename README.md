# Kerolauncher
Kerolauncher is a cross-platform CLI launcher for playing Touhou and configuring save data. The main target operative systems are Linux-based operative systems and Windows.

For Linux, Kerolauncher supports Wine or Lutris to launch the games, while for Windows it executes the game natively (of course). Every other feature is system-agnostic.

MacOS and BSD-based systems are not supported by Lutris

# How to use
Download kerolauncher.rb and (if you haven't yet) install Ruby on your system. Kerolauncher is an interpreted program so it requires the Ruby interpreter to work.

Open kerolauncher.rb and explore the configuration settings, this setup is required

After everything is configured, you can execute the launcher from a terminal with ```ruby kerolauncher.rb```
